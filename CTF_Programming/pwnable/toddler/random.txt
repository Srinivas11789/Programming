PWNABLE - SOLVE FOR RANDOM

The C program clearly shows that the "random_number" XORED with the input "key" provides the hex value deadbeef

* This does not have any leads as the random number generated is not known

* The only way to do it is to run the C program to print the values in another machine - LEAD1 - Is that the RAND here generates the same number everytime - 1804289383

* Test the Key which satisfies for the equation ( 1804289383 ^ key = deadbeef )

* Answer -> Calculate Bitwise XOR online ---> 1804289383 ^ deadbeef(3735928559) = 3039230856(Key)

Good!
Mommy, I thought libc random is unpredictable...
